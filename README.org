* Requirements
The project uses Docker images to run its services, and this images
are based on ARM7 architecture, however it is still possible to run
them in =x86= or =amd64= architectures by installing the following
packages in Debian based distributions:

#+begin_src bash
  apt install qemu binfmt-support qemu-user-static
#+end_src

Other requirements to use all the features in the project:
- DMK 41BU02 Camera.
- LSM303 Sensor.
- DS1621 Sensor.
** Installing the DMK 41BU02 Camera
These are the steps needed to install this specific camera in the
Raspberry Pi:
*** Clone tiscamera repo
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/TheImagingSource/tiscamera.git
#+end_src
*** Build dependencies
#+begin_src sh
cd tiscamera
sudo ./scripts/install-dependencies.sh --runtime --compilation
#+end_src
*** Build tiscamera
#+begin_src sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
# Without ARAVIS
cmake -DBUILD_ARAVIS=OFF -DBUILD_TOOLS=ON ..
make
sudo make install
#+end_src
*** Workaround
If the device does not show up, the following workaround might help:
#+begin_src sh
  /bin/sh -c 'echo 199e 8101 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/uvcvideo/new_id'
#+end_src
** Installing the DS1621 Sensor
#+begin_src shell
  echo ds1621 0x48 >/sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/new_device
  pip3 install smbus
#+end_src
